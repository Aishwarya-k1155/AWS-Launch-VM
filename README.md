# AWS Launch VM

## Objective
The main goal of this task was to get hands-on experience with cloud virtual machines. I wanted to learn how to create an EC2 instance in AWS, connect to it via SSH, and perform basic Linux commands.

## Tools I Used
- AWS Free Tier account  
- AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)  
- SSH client (or browser-based terminal)  
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS  

## What I Did

1. **Logged in to AWS**  
   I logged into my AWS Management Console and opened the EC2 Dashboard. I confirmed that my Free Tier account was active so I could practice without incurring any costs.

2. **Created a New EC2 Instance**  
   I clicked **Launch Instance** and configured the following:  
   - **Instance Name:** `cloud-vm`  
   - **Operating System:** Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (Free Tier Eligible)  
   - **Instance Type:** t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM)  
   - **Key Pair:** `cloudvmkey.pem` (for SSH access)  
   - **Network Settings:** Enabled HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)  
   - **Region:** North Virginia (us-east-1)  
   After reviewing the settings, I launched the instance and waited for it to pass the 2/2 status checks.

3. **Connected to the EC2 Instance via SSH**  
   Using my key pair and the public IP address of the instance, I connected via SSH. I ran basic Linux commands like `uname -a`, `ls`, and `whoami` to confirm that the server was working correctly. This gave me hands-on experience managing a remote server.

4. **Stopped the EC2 Instance**  
   After testing, I stopped the instance to avoid unnecessary charges. This taught me the importance of **responsible cloud resource management**.

5. **Checked VM Configuration**  
   I reviewed the configuration of my instance:  
   - Instance Name: `cloud-vm`  
   - Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
   - Region: North Virginia (us-east-1)  
   - Instance Type: t2.micro (Free Tier Eligible)  
   - Key Pair: `cloudvmkey.pem`  
   - Firewall Rules: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22)  
   - Connection Method: SSH (Client or Browser Terminal)

6. **Took Screenshots**  
   I captured three screenshots showing my SSH session and instance details to demonstrate that everything was set up correctly.

## What I Learned
- Learned how to create and configure an **AWS EC2 instance**.  
- Practiced connecting to a remote server using **SSH**.  
- Understood **basic Linux commands** in a cloud environment.  
- Learned the importance of **stopping instances** to manage costs and resources.  
- Gained hands-on experience with **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)**.

## Conclusion
This task provided practical exposure to **AWS EC2 and cloud VM management**. I now feel confident working with remote servers, performing basic Linux operations, and managing cloud resources effectively.
